# EventPlatform

EventPlatform is a web app where users can book events and admin members can add events. 

### Frontend: <a href="[https://checkmyevents.netlify.app/]/">Events Web App</a>
Visitors can view all available events. Once signed in as a user you can book events and add booked events to Google Calendar. As an admin, you can add an event, make another user admin and delete events. To see the admin features use the login details: email address: admin@admin.com with password admin123. 

### Backend: <a href="[https://events-sihs.onrender.com/events]">Events API</a>
View all events - soon I will update with an API endpoint with all available endpoints for this app.
