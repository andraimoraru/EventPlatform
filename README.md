# EventPlatform

EventPlatform is a web app where users can book events and admin members can add events. 

### Frontend: <a href="https://checkmyevents.netlify.app//"> Events Web App</a>
Visitors can view all available events. Once signed in as a user you can book events and add them to their Google Calendar. If you'd like to test this feature contact me at andraimoraru@gmail.com to add your email as a test user. 

As an admin, you can add an event, make another user admin and delete events. 
To see the admin features use the login details: 

email address: admin@admin.com 
password admin123. 

### Backend: <a href="https://events-sihs.onrender.com/events"> Events API</a>

View all events - soon I will update with an API endpoint with all available endpoints for this app.
